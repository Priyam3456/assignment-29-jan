Ans-1 The Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum.

Ans-2-Python is a versatile, multi-paradigm programming language that supports several programming styles:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python allows for defining classes and creating objects, enabling encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Functional Programming: Python supports functions as first-class citizens, allowing you to pass functions as arguments, return them from other functions, and create closures.
Procedural Programming: Python can execute a series of statements in procedures or functions, making it suitable for procedural programming.
Imperative Programming: Python can be used to write programs that give the computer a set of sequential instructions to perform a task.

Ans-3- Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers. In Python, identifiers include names given to variables, functions, classes, and other objects. This means that Variable, variable, and VARIABLE would be recognized as three distinct identifiers in Python

Ans-4- the correct extension is .py

Ans-5- it is interpreted

Ans-6-n Python, a block of code is a group of statements that can be executed as a unit. These are some common blocks of code used in Python:

Modules: Entire Python files or scripts that can be imported into other Python programs.
Functions: Defined using the def keyword, functions contain a set of statements that perform a task.
Classes: Defined using the class keyword, classes are blueprints for creating objects (instances).
If Blocks: Used for conditional execution of code.
For Loops: Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).
While Loops: Used for repeated execution as long as an expression is true.
Try-Except Blocks: Used for exception handling.

Ans-13- Python offers numerous benefits that make it a popular choice for programmers and organizations. Here are some key advantages:

Ease of Learning: Python has a simple and readable syntax, which makes it an excellent language for beginners123.
Versatility: It can be used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more123.
Extensive Libraries: Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that simplify tasks in various domains123.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python programs can run on various operating systems without requiring changes to the code123.
Community Support: A large and active community contributes to a wealth of resources and support123.
Open Source: Python is free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes23.
High Demand: Python developers are in high demand in the job market, and the language often leads to competitive salaries3.
These benefits contribute to Python’s reputation as a powerful and flexible programming language suitable for a wide range of applications.

Ans - 14-Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python memory manager. The key features of Python’s memory management include:

Garbage Collection: Python uses garbage collection to clean up unused memory. This process involves identifying and freeing memory that is no longer in use by the program1.
Reference Counting: Python keeps track of the number of references to each object in memory. When an object’s reference count drops to zero, meaning no references to it exist, it is eligible for garbage collection123.
Memory Allocation: Python has a private heap space where all objects and data structures are stored. The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python’s memory manager12.
Stack Memory: The stack memory is used for static and global variable storage and for storing function calls

Ans-16- not required
